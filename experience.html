                            I have been working at OIT here at BYU for the past year and a half. This has allowed 
                            me to gain a deeper understanding for technical troublshooting for a variety of different
                            services and general problem solving. It has also allowed me to become acquainted with services like Adobe
                            and many of the Microsoft apps.
                        </p>

                            During high school, I worked for my father for his contruction company. While working for him,
                            I was able to learn how to practice manual labor and understand the meaning of hard work and persistance.
                            I also was able to understand more of the business side of how to run one and dealing with things like
                            paying workers, managing financial statements, and managerial decisions.
                        </p>

                           I was able to serve an LDS mission in Honduras for 2 years. There I was able to practice and become 
                           fluent in the Spanish language. I was also able to learn how to interact and adopt different cultures 
                           into my own life. It allowed me to change my perspective and become more compassionate. 
                        </p>
